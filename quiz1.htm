            <a href="tennis.com" target="_blank" style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> Tennis</a> is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of
            two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered
            with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a
            way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player unable to return the ball validly will not gain a
            point, while the opposite player will.[1][2].

            Playable at all levels of society and at all ages, tennis can be played
            by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The original forms of tennis developed in France during
            the late Middle Ages.[3] The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn
            tennis.[4] It had close connections to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older 
            racket sport today called real tennis.[5]
            The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to
            keep one foot on the ground at all times,[6][7] and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s.[8] A recent addition to
            professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which
            allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as <a style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Hawk-Eye</a>.[9][10]
