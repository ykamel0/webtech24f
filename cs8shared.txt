                The sweet orange is not a wild fruit,[14] having arisen in domestication from a cross between a non-pure
                mandarin orange and a hybrid pomelo that had a substantial mandarin component. Since its chloroplast DNA
                is that of pomelo, it was likely the hybrid pomelo, perhaps a BC1 pomelo backcross, that was the
                maternal parent of the first orange.[4][15] Based on genomic analysis, the relative proportions of the
                ancestral species in the sweet orange are approximately 42% pomelo and 58% mandarin.[16] All varieties
                of the sweet orange descend from this prototype cross, differing only by mutations selected for during
                agricultural propagation.[15] Sweet oranges have a distinct origin from the bitter orange, which arose
                independently, perhaps in the wild, from a cross between pure mandarin and pomelo parents.[15] The
                earliest mention of the sweet orange in Chinese literature dates from 314 BC.[2]



                In Europe, the Moors introduced the orange to the Iberian Peninsula, which was known as Al-Andalus, with
                large-scale cultivation starting in the 10th century, as evidenced by complex irrigation techniques
                specifically adapted to support orange orchards.[17] Citrus fruits—among them the bitter orange—were
                introduced to Sicily in the 9th century during the period of the Emirate of Sicily, but the sweet orange
                was unknown until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and
                Portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the Mediterranean area.[7] Shortly afterward, the sweet
                orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit. It was considered a luxury food grown by wealthy people
                in private conservatories, called orangeries. By 1646, the sweet orange was well known throughout
                Europe.[7] Louis XIV of France had a great love of orange trees and built the grandest of all royal
                Orangeries at the Palace of Versailles.[18] At Versailles, potted orange trees in solid silver tubs were
                placed throughout the rooms of the palace, while the Orangerie allowed year-round cultivation of the
                fruit to supply the court. When Louis condemned his finance minister, Nicolas Fouquet, in 1664, part of
                the treasures that he confiscated were over 1,000 orange trees from Fouquet's estate at
                Vaux-le-Vicomte.[19]

                 Spanish travelers introduced the sweet orange to the American continent. On his second voyage in 1493,
                Christopher Columbus may have planted the fruit on Hispaniola.[20] Subsequent expeditions in the
                mid-1500s brought sweet oranges to South America and Mexico, and to Florida in 1565, when Pedro Menéndez
                de Avilés founded St Augustine. Spanish missionaries brought orange trees to Arizona between 1707 and
                1710, while the Franciscans did the same in San Diego, California, in 1769.[7] An orchard was planted at
                the San Gabriel Mission around 1804, and a commercial orchard was established in 1841 near present-day
                Los Angeles. In Louisiana, oranges were probably introduced by French explorers.
                Archibald Menzies, the botanist and naturalist on the Vancouver Expedition, collected orange seeds in
                South Africa, raised the seedlings onboard, and gave them to several Hawaiian chiefs in 1792.
                Eventually, the sweet orange was grown in wide areas of the Hawaiian Islands, but its cultivation
                stopped after the arrival of the Mediterranean fruit fly in the early 1900s.[7][21]
